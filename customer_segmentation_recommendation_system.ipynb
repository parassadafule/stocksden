However, considering the context of this project where the final goal is to understand customer behavior and preferences through K-means clustering, it would be more prudent to address the issue of outliers __after the feature engineering phase__ where we create a customer-centric dataset. At this stage, the data is transactional, and removing outliers might eliminate valuable information that could play a crucial role in segmenting customers later on. Therefore, we will postpone the outlier treatment and proceed to the next stage for now."
